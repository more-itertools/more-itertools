        More Itertools
        ==============
        
        I love itertools; it's one of the most beautiful, composable standard libs.
        Whenever I have an iteration problem, there's almost always an itertools
        routine that fits it perfectly. Sometimes, however, neither itertools nor the
        recipes included in its docs do quite what I need.
        
        Here I've collected several routines I've reached for but not found. Since
        they are deceptively tricky to get right, I've wrapped them up into a library.
        We've also included implementations of the recipes from the itertools
        documentation. Enjoy! Any additions are welcome; just file a pull request.

        Version History
        ===============
        
        2.3
            * Added ``one`` from ``jaraco.util.itertools``. (Thanks, jaraco!)
            * Added ``distinct_permutations``. (Thanks, Bo Bayles!)
        
        2.2
            * Added ``iterate`` and ``with_iter``. (Thanks, abarnert!)
        
        2.1
            * Added (tested!) implementations of the recipes from the itertools
              documentation. (Thanks, Chris Lonnen!)
            * Added ``ilen``. (Thanks for the inspiration, Matt Basta!)
        
        2.0
            * ``chunked`` now returns lists rather than tuples. After all, they're
              homogeneous. This slightly backward-incompatible change is the reason for
              the major version bump.
            * Added ``@consumer``.
            * Improved test machinery.
        
        1.1
            * Added ``first`` function.
            * Added Python 3 support.
            * Added a default arg to ``peekable.peek()``.
            * Noted how to easily test whether a peekable iterator is exhausted.
            * Rewrote documentation.
        
        1.0
            * Initial release, with ``collate``, ``peekable``, and ``chunked``. Could
              really use better docs.
